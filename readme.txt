Adds one new game mode (Tallest), and two new difficulties (Heroic and Crazy) for all new and existing game modes!

New Game mode: Tallest

With the same blocks, be on the one to build the highest tower! Once your tower is finished, the tower will freeze in place and the game will wait for all other towers to finish. Only starting powerups are enabled.


New Difficulty: Heroic

Harder or more competitive versions of existing game modes.

In puzzle, two disjoint thin towers are the base.
In race, most positive spells are removed, and negative spells are nastier.
In survival, negative spells are boosted and spells are more common.
In tallest, more blocks are available and an ivy spell for strategic placement.

New Difficulty: Crazy

Twists on existing game modes.

In puzzle: only a few random single blocks are available as a base.
In race: the base is two disjoint columns, and petrify and island powerups are disabled.
In survival: single life with tricky negative spells give tough choices for spells at each point.
In tallest: blocks come in sets of 4 of the same block, how will your tower shape up?
